    according to the algorithm of Jain et al. specified in 
    "The power of pivoting for exact clique counting." (WSDM 2020).

    This code is a modified version of the code of quick-cliques-1.0 library for counting 
    maximal cliques by Darren Strash (first name DOT last name AT gmail DOT com).
